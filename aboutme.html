        <h2> Ive learned a lot today especially with the similarities between Python and Scratch. No Python doesnt have the tabs like Scratch ,but it lets you write the same formulas out.Also debugging my program was awesome it was really hard ,but with the mistakes we made something new
<h3>Today I succeded in making a LED turn on and just for the fun my group added a button to power it. It was amazing.
