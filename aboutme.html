        <p1> Ive learned a lot today especially with the similarities between Python and Scratch. No Python doesnt have the tabs like Scratch ,but it lets you write the same formulas out.Also debugging my program was awesome it was really hard ,but with the mistakes we made something new </p1>

      <h1> My Reflection </h1>
      <p> I learned that things are sent through the internt through bytes. </p>
      <p1> From learning what LaTeX is I would think that its a programming language becuase its based upon it being more of a format of a language instead of it just being about the interior design of it.

      <p> I would like to practice more codeing on django becuase I feel that I dont understand on the concept of how to get to certain parts.
        <p1> I also would like to say that when I do get my webssite up and running Id like to add pictures and a cooler design but those are ony feature creeps at the moment
