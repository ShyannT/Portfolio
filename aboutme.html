        <p1> Ive learned a lot today especially with the similarities between Python and Scratch. No Python doesnt have the tabs like Scratch ,but it lets you write the same formulas out.
          Also debugging my program was awesome it was really hard ,but with the mistakes we made something new </p1>
<p2>Today I succeded in making a LED turn on and just for the fun my group added a button to power it.

        <P1> Working on ciruits in groups made thinking about the future in making robots exciting. 
          When working in grops it easier when we all gave a input on how we would sole it and then try it out it was all about trial and error.

      <p> I learned that things are sent through the internt through bytes. </p>
      <p1> From learning what LaTeX is I would think that its a programming language becuase its based upon it being more of a format of a language instead of it just being about the interior design of it.

          <H1> Recipe Box </H1>work at perfecting everything.
          <P1> Today we where in partners making a recipe box. The recipe box we had to code to input the recipe for any food and we choose tres leches. 
            Also computers are good with data becuase they work at perfecting everything.
          </P1>
          <P2> Sadly we didnt get to finish the recipe we only put in the directions and ingredients for the recipe. 
            Also the hardest part was starting it after we had gotten it to start everything was working out smoothly.

     <h1> ITS MY BIRTHDAY, but back to the code</h1>
     <p1> I feel like the objects helped me becuase they gave everything more a exact task for me. I also did find it difficult at times
       when I had to code it. </p1>
     <p2> The problem I had was getting it to work and even though I didn't I got to understand it more when people went up for the code storm.
